# Disaster Events Analytics Dashboard Portfolio

**1. Project Overview**

The Disaster Events Analytics Dashboard is an advanced data visualization project designed to analyze the global impact of natural disasters across economic, humanitarian, and infrastructural dimensions.
The dashboard consolidates multi-year disaster data into a single interactive decision-support system, enabling users to monitor trends, assess risks, and evaluate aid effectiveness across regions, disaster types, months, and years.
This project demonstrates the ability to transform complex disaster data into clear insights for policymakers, NGOs, emergency response teams, and decision-makers.

**2. Project Scope**

**The project scope includes:**
* Analysis of economic losses caused by disasters
* Evaluation of affected population trends
* Assessment of aid distribution efficiency
* Monitoring infrastructure damage index
* Identification of high-risk regions and disaster types
* Time-series analysis (YoY & MoM growth)
* Geographic visualization of global disaster impact
The dashboard supports risk management, disaster preparedness, and humanitarian planning.

 **3. Methodology**
 
A structured end-to-end analytics workflow was applied:

**Data Preparation**

* Data validation and consistency checks
* Cleaning and standardization of disaster categories
* Handling missing or outlier values
  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Trend analysis by year and month
* Comparison across disaster types
* Regional impact evaluation
  
**KPI Development**

* Defined metrics aligned with humanitarian and economic performance
* Created YoY and MoM growth measures
  
**Data Modeling & DAX**

* Optimized relationships for performance
* Custom measures for growth, totals, and indexes
  
**Dashboard Design**

* Executive-level KPI cards
* Interactive slicers (Year, Month, Disaster Type)
* Maps, bar charts, donut charts, and trend lines
Clean, professional color theme for clarity

 **4. Data Source**
 
* Structured disaster events dataset
  
**Includes:**
* Disaster type
* Location
* Economic loss estimates
* Affected population counts
* Aid provided
* Infrastructure damage index
(Dataset modeled to simulate real-world disaster analytics use cases.)

**5. Tools Used**

* Power BI – dashboard development & data modeling
* DAX – KPIs, YoY & MoM calculations
* Microsoft Excel – preprocessing & validation
* Data Visualization Best Practices
* Analytical & Statistical Reasoning

**6. Results & Key Findings**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* Total Aid Provided: 20K
* Total Affected Population: 553M
* Total Economic Loss: $96.62B
* Infrastructure Damage Index: 11.15K
* Number of Disaster Types: 7
  
**Analytical Insights**

* Economic losses show significant year-over-year variation
* Floods and earthquakes consistently cause high economic damage
* Certain regions receive high aid relative to population affected
* Infrastructure damage trends highlight long-term recovery risks
* Seasonal patterns exist in disaster occurrence and impact
* Aid distribution is not always proportional to loss severity

**7. Recommendations**

**Disaster Risk Management**

* Strengthen early-warning systems in high-impact regions
* Prioritize infrastructure resilience in disaster-prone areas
  
**Humanitarian Response**

* Optimize aid allocation using data-driven thresholds
* Introduce predictive analytics for future disaster planning
  
**Dashboard Enhancements**

* Integrate real-time disaster feeds
* Add forecasting models for loss and population impact
* Expand regional drill-down analysis

 **8. Conclusion**
 
This project demonstrates strong capability in:

* Business Intelligence & Power BI
* KPI design and performance monitoring
* Data storytelling and visualization
* Time-series and geographic analysis
* Translating data into actionable insights
  
The Disaster Events Dashboard is a decision-ready analytical tool suitable for humanitarian agencies, governments, NGOs, and research organizations.
