# Disaster Events Analytics Dashboard Portfolio

**1. Project Overview**

The Disaster Events Analytics Dashboard is an advanced data visualization project designed to analyze the global impact of natural disasters across economic, humanitarian, and infrastructural dimensions.
The dashboard consolidates multi-year disaster data into a single interactive decision-support system, enabling users to monitor trends, assess risks, and evaluate aid effectiveness across regions, disaster types, months, and years.
This project demonstrates the ability to transform complex disaster data into clear insights for policymakers, NGOs, emergency response teams, and decision-makers.
